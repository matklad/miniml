[miniml](http://andrej.com/plzoo/) implementation in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

`cargo run` to run the repl, `cargo test` to run the tests. You can install Rust and Cargo
[here](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html)

Some tests are [here](https://github.com/matklad/miniml/blob/master/src/tests.rs).

Parser is generated by [LALRPOP](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/lalrpop) from the grammar
at the `syntax/src/parser.lalrpop`.

Typechecker is at `src/typecheck.rs`, it operates on the AST.

The AST is converted to untyped desugared intermediate representation at `src/ir.rs`. `let` and
`let rec` a desugared to lambda functions. Looks like the VM language is not general enough to encode
mutual recursion directly.

IR is converted to VM instructions in `src/compile`. The machine itself is in `src/machine`.
